# Domain Names and DNS

Use [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) to buy and maintain domain names. If you already have a domain registered elsewhere, domain registrar provides a transfer service that makes it easy to switch.

We like it for its simplicity. It also has templates we most often need:

* Heroku
* Google Apps
* Cloudflare
* Fastly
* GitHub Pages
* Netlify

Follow the [Custom Domains](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) tutorial to set up root and subdomains on Heroku.
