# Payment Processing

For collecting payments from users via credit or debit card, we use different payment gateways [Stripe](http://stripe.com/), [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) and [PayUbiz](https://www.payubiz.in/). It is a payment gateway and merchant account. We also use it for recurring billing.

Charges for Stripe will vary depending on usage. Successful credit card charges are 2.9% + 30 cents. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or card storage fees.
