# Use an extensible editor

> Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing. The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable. â€“ [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X)

Almost all developers at CodeCarrot use **Visual Studio Code** or **Atom** as their text editor.

When we use  **Visual Studio Code** or **Atom**, we type few characters and avoid the mouse. We're productive and more easily achieve flow.

It's great because:

* Visual Studio Code is fast and starts up instantly.
* Atom is a hackable text editor which comes with awesome set of features like Real-time collaboration, IDE features, Git and GitHub integration.
* Both Visual Studio Code and Atom has a rich ecosystem of open-source plugins.
