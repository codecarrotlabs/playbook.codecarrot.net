# Phase 0: Prepare

Before the sprint, our clients schedule 5 real humans for the tests we'll do in the last phase. They know their users better than we do.

They also gather research from sources such as:

* [Quora](http://quora.com/)
* [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/)
* [Adwords Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home)

We may also do some \(paid\) prep-work:

* Schedule and run [user interviews](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/interviewing-users/).
* Deploy a short [survey](http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/use_cases) whose results we can review in the first phase.

We typically order breakfast for the first day to make it feel special but don't order lunch for each day of the sprint. For both the sprints and normal days, we believe it's important to not have "working lunches", instead breaking from work for a short time to rest the brain, maybe get some fresh air, and interact with teammates and clients.
