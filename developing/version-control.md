# Version Control

We always use source code control. It's like a time machine. We can work in parallel universes of our source code, experimenting without fear of losing work, rolling back if something goes wrong.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is an open source source code control system written by Linus Torvalds. It's fast and great for working in branches.

We use [GitHub](http://github.com/codecarrotnet) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/codecarrot) for hosting our Git repositories.
