# Test-Driven Development

[Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html) is perhaps the most important Extreme Programming (XP) rule that we practice.

Business benefits of TDD:

* Deliver more value, faster
* Always ship working software
* Adapt to change quickly

Code benefits of TDD:

* Readable specs and code
* Clean public interfaces
* Decoupled modules

Process benefits of TDD:

* Regression safety net
* Fearless refactoring
* Team trust

At a high level, how to test is very simple:

* Write test first.
* Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
