# AARRR Framework

Dave McClure's AARRR framework provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.

The AARRR framework is:

* Acquisition
* Activation
* Retention
* Revenue
* Referral

For an early stage product, we work to improve them in this order:

1. Activation: visitor finds the product desirable enough to try, is able to use it and get to [aha moment](http://www.growhack.com/2012/12/discovering-your-aha-moment/) in shortest time possible
2. Retention: user regularly uses product, it is doing the job they hired it for, customer is happy
3. Revenue: user pays for product
4. Acquisition: we know where our users come from, are able to try new channels, run tests, and kill or double-down on different channels
5. Referral: users refer other users, the ideal acquisition channel
